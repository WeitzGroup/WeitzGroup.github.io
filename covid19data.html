<tr><td width=50></td><td style="width:800px;vertical-align:top"><p> <br> <br>COVID-19 is a pandemic that has spread across the world -- including to Georgia. To show how coronavirus is impacting Georgia we visualise daily data collated by the <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data">New York Times</a> from local health authorities. The most recent data and more visualisations can be found on the <a href="https://dph.georgia.gov/covid-19-daily-status-report">Georgia DPH daily status</a> website. The first recorded case of COVID-19 was made in Fulton county in early March. Shortly after, a cluster of cases was discovered in Dougherty county -- thought to have spread amongst a large funeral gathering. Since then, COVID-19 has been transmitted across many communities in the state.
<p> <br>
It is important to note that this visualisation only serves as a proxy for actual cases in Georgia, yet despite limitations the data is still useful. New data is reflective of tests carried out several days before the recording date due to the time it takes to perform diagnostic tests. It may take several days for those infected to show symptoms that would lead them to seek testing, adding a further lag. Additionally, many infectious people with COVID-19 may have no symptoms, and therefore will be less likely to seek testing. The availability and accessibility of testing also affects the ability to detect COVID-19 prevalence. Ascertaining the true scale of the number of cases is a challenge that will require large-scale testing. <a href="https://weitzgroup.github.io/MAGEmodel_covid19_GA/">Modelling efforts</a> suggest that there could be 5-10x more cases than those reported. 
<p> <br>
To visualise this dataset we choose to use a log-scale as cases are expected to increase exponentially. For example, if each infectious person were to infect one additional person per day the number of infected people would double every day - a characteristic of exponential growth. By using a log-scale it is possible to look at spread across magnitudes, rather than just those counties with the largest recorded numbers.
